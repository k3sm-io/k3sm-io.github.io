# k3sm gen-1 installer:   curl -fsSL https://k3sm.io/install.sh | sh
#
# Canonical copy: github.com/k3sm-io/k3sm/install.sh. The served copy at
# https://k3sm.io/install.sh MUST stay byte-identical to this file; the two are
# compared before every site publish, so read either and get the same script.
#
# What it does: preflight (Apple silicon + macOS 26+) → fetch the release
# tarball + checksums from GitHub Releases → sha256-verify → print the
# pre-escalation banner → run `sudo k3sm install` (the first-class installer:
# creates /Library/k3sm, the _k3sm user, and the io.k3sm.netd + io.k3sm.server
# LaunchDaemons). Re-running upgrades in place (both daemons restart briefly);
# pin K3SM_INSTALL_VERSION to repair without jumping to latest.
#
# Configuration (env only):
#   K3SM_INSTALL_VERSION        release tag to install (v0.1.0 or 0.1.0); default: latest
#   K3SM_INSTALL_BASE_URL       default https://github.com/k3sm-io/k3sm/releases (https-only)
#   K3SM_INSTALL_DOWNLOAD_ONLY  =1: download + verify into the current dir; never runs sudo
#
# NOTE: external commands (sudo curl sysctl sw_vers uname shasum tar) are
# invoked by BARE NAME deliberately — the B137 acceptance gate substitutes them
# via PATH. Do not absolutize them "for hardening"; it breaks the gate.
#
# The checksum verify is same-origin INTEGRITY (the tarball matches the
# checksums file published beside it), not publisher identity. Provenance
# (Developer-ID + notarization) arrives with the .pkg generation — see
# https://k3sm.io/install/ for the install-channel ladder.
